# Snowman

Snowman is a simple Apple Watch game. The objective is to draw letters to guess the word or phrase before the snowman melts.

## Purpose

Snowman was built to demonstrate using CoreML to build a game for watchOS 4. The project includes an Apple Watch app and several scripts to train handwriting recognition models that are compatible with CoreML.

## Presentation

- Snowman was built as a companion app to demonstrate new watchOS 4 features, and as an example of how to use CoreML on watchOS. 
- The presentation that describes how Snowman was built and many other capabilities of watchOS 4 can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/cnstoll/the-latest-in-developing-for-watchos).

## Building Snowman

- Snowman requires Xcode 9 (latest version), iOS 11, and watchOS 4

## Machine Learning

- Snowman uses a handwriting recognition model trained on the Extended MNIST data set. 
- For more information on training a handwriting recognition model, read the README and scripts located in the Training folder.

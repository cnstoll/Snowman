# Snowman

Snowman is a simple Apple Watch game. The objective is to draw letters to guess the word or phrase before the snowman melts.

Snowman was built as a demonstration of using CoreML to build a game for watchOS 4. The project includes an Apple Watch app and several scripts to train handwriting recognition models that are compatible with CoreML.

For more information on training a handwriting recognition model, read the README and scripts located in the Training folder.
